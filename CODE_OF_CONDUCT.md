## Enforcement Responsibilities

Napier group F are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of
acceptable behaviour and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any behaviour that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,
or harmful.

Napier group F have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation
decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all Napier Group F spaces, and applies when
an individual is officially representing Napier University in public spaces.
Examples of representing our Napier University include using an official e-mail address,
posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behaviour may be
reported to Kevin Sim who is responsible for enforcement of all complaints.
Complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

Napier group F are obligated to respect the privacy and security of any incident that would have an impact on Napier University.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Napier group F will determine the consequences for unacceptable behaviour and will enforce the below actions:
If a team member is late more than twice, they must buy Napier group F a coffee.
If a team member doesnâ€™t contribute, they will be reported at the next lab meeting.
If a team member is absent for more than 4 weeks, they will be reported to Kevin Sim.

Consequence
A private meeting will take place with Kevin Sim who will provide
clarity around the nature of the enforcement and an explanation of why the
behaviour was inappropriate. 

### 2. Warning

A warning with consequences will be issued for continued behaviour such as:
No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with
those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period. This
includes avoiding interactions in Napier group F spaces as well as external channels
like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or
permanent ban.
