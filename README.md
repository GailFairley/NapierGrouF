Attempting user stories
As an employee of X, I require 25 specific reports where a condition is provided by the user,so we would not have to recreate them daily for day to day operations.
As an employee of X, I require a static report of population by different sized areas, so we could look up this information easily each time.
As an employee of X, I require a report that provides the number of people who speak selected languages from greatest number to smallest, including the percentage of the world population for day to day operations.
As an employee of X, I require all reports to have specified columns so that we have consistency across the business.
